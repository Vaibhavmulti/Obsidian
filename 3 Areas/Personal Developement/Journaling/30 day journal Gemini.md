# 📔 The 30-Day Journaling Blueprint

### **The Daily Framework**

Before answering the daily prompt, complete these two quick exercises to ground yourself.

**1. The "2+1" Morning Launch**

- **2 Specific Gratitudes:** Two tiny things from the last 24 hours (e.g., "The perfect temperature of my coffee").
    
- **1 Intention:** One value-aligned focus for today/tomorrow.
    

**2. The "3-Question" Evening Landing**

- **Energy Drain:** What took my energy away today?
    
- **Energy Gain:** What gave me energy today?
    
- **Self-Discovery:** One thing I learned about myself today.

### **Tips for Success**

- **The 2-Minute Rule:** If you’re exhausted, just write the **2+1** section. Don't break the chain.
    
- **Be Messy:** This isn't for publication. Use bullet points, bad grammar, or drawings if that helps you express yourself better.
    
- **Reviewing:** Every Sunday (the "Review" days), read your entries from the previous week. It’s the most important step for "knowing yourself better."

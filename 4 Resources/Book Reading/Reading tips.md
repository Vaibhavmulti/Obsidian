Use the index page of the book to write down what interesting thing is there at that page.

Use the last page of the book physical to keep the most important lessons , use a plain digital page like we did for great mental models. I think that was great. Make a mind map for the book simultaneously.

We can write the actionable advices too , another page for this or include in the mind map.

Wait a while to highlight things (learn as you go where to stop , else everything feels like interesting and we are forced to highlight) as it breaks the flow of reading.

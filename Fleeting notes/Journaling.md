[[Ali Abdall]] prompts :


(THINK DAY)
If you are planning to go to a new location take some prompts with you and have a mini uninterrupted retreat. 2-3 hrs / half a day or so deeply answer questions, you'll have lots of insights. 


3-3-1
3 gratitudes. Be very specific.
3 self awareness prompts.
One Directional Intention (For Tomorrow). Makes it actionable.

Weekly 
Weekly Deep Reflection (30–45 mins on Sunday)
Answer these:
1. What worked this week?
2. What didn’t?
3. Where did I waste time?
4. What did I learn about myself?
5. What kind of person did I act like this week?
6. "What are three things I would do even if I knew I would never get paid or recognized for them?"
7. "What does 'success' look like to me right now, and how much of that definition is actually mine?"
8. "If I were to teach a class on something _not_ related to AI or CS, what would it be?"
9. Who in my life am I thankful for, and how can I show it?

Notice patterns weekly. Read entries to look for what is emerging.


This is where real self-knowledge develops.

Tips for effective writing:
- Go for depth over breadth: Elaborate on one item if it feels meaningful.
- View positives as "gifts" to amplify appreciation.
- Include "subtraction" thinking: Reflect on what your life would be like without certain positives.

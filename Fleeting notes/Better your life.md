Figuring out where you are in life

Rate yourself out of 10 out of each of these.

I am tempted to rate myself based on my routine that I used to follow but that is not the case anymore, so either we can hope that we will follow that and rate accordingly or we can mention why we should follow it.
Let's rate both ways 

Ideal routine             |                What we are doing right now

Health:
- Physical : 9 (4-5 times a week including hiit which was great for cardiovascular and overall strength building),    4 ( Too much alcohol , too less exercise and too less walks)
- Mental : 5 (Too much stress while placements about the unknown, constant stress). 6 (No stress but lack of motive and feeling what am I doing)
- Spiritual : 7 (Meditation routine, helped a bit could have been better) , 7 (Sitting here feels nice , quiet and spiritual , water sound , birds , people just walking around don't care, could use more of this)

Work:
- Mission : 9 (Learning directly what I want to learn for the rest of the life) , 5 (Not directly learning , procrastinating in the face of productivity but yeah we are relaxing , is this good? Are we missing something?)
- Money : 7 (Broke but got a decent job), 6 (Are we managing good ? Well I don't think much for experiences which I feel is nice , and I don't like to feel that we have less, make enough to have the freedom to enjoy experience without every thinking about money)
- Growth: 6 (Only technical, should include personal book reading), 6 (No technical but giving time to what matters (note taking , system building), still include books )

Relationship:
- Family : 4 (Always missing from functions while in kanpur, didn't hate it but yeah ), 6 (Was more in functions, giving time to family ? Not really they are missing my presence)
- Friends : 8 (Adequate time there), 8 (Adequate time now )
- Romantic : 7 (Always made the time but state of mind was not right ), 7 (Present for here but don't want to pin her for her mistakes and what I expect of her)

What needs to be worked and actionable advice:

What needs to be worked in ideal routine?
Mental health : Don't be too strict, do a little less to have some breathing space so that stress is not there and make sure to have good time each day.
Spiritual health : Meditate consistently , follow different guided meditation and listen to different people in waking up.
Money: Have a side money generating project so that we can be financially free.
Work Growth: Have a reading routine, block time , incorporate readwise to remove the mental toll of remembering.
Family: Be present whenever you are with them. Try to spend more time with them.
Romantic relationship : Try to listen to her more , what she actually wants , don't let your state of mind get into your relationship.

What needs to be worked now?
Physical health: Drink less, exercise more.
Mental health: If you are note relaxing or feeling like you are missing out or anything else just be clear with your priorities, work and relax.
Spiritual health: Mediate more, waking up 
Work mission : A little break but follow the idea routine to get back 
Money: Same as idea one
Growth, Family, Romantic relationships.: Same



Clearly if I was following the ideal routine I had less things to work on so better to follow it. 


==Best of both worlds:
Physical health : 4-5 times a week and health through out the day. Less drinking more healthy food and good sleep.
Mental health : Have breathing space do a little less but do all that you desire.
Spiritual health : Do waking up consistently, and have this sit out routines more.
Work mission : Daily 1 hr for what you want to learn for the rest of your life. Productivity should be a very minimal part of it.
Money: Have a money generating side business and spend on experiences.
Growth : Have a book reading habit (20 mins a day) ReadWise for remembering.
Family : Be more present and more with them.
Friends : Only category which does not need work.
Romantic : Listen more to what she really wants. Bit a less practical and more emotional with her.




Figure out the things that you want to improve, then have a 12 month celebration thing. Where do I want to see myself in 12 months / what one thing  do I want to celebrate after 12 months of work in the thing that needs to be improved.

A key hack while setting goals , add the phrase while enjoying everything along the way at the end of the goal :)
Write the goals down! and make recurring reviews (monthly/quarterly..)


Mind optimises for safety not for growth.






**What would I do if I knew I couldn’t fail?**
Professional Sports.


Go full on side projects that will make us financially free.

**“Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?”

Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen? 
If we decide to go full on the side project for financially free thing, we can aim for 2 years living with parents nothing will happen we can just resume back from where we started. We can pause the sips , insurance can be done by parents. Consider doing this if we see hope later actually take years off.




1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?  
    
2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control?  
    
3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of these more likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?  
    
4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?  
    
5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous business people for advice.  
    
6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.  
    
7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and repairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.




8. What would you do if money were no object? 
    
9. If you didn’t care about making money, how would you use your talents and skills to serve other people?
    
10. What would I like people to say at my funeral? And to what extent am I currently living aligned with that future?
    
11. If I repeat this week’s actions for the next ten years, where does it lead and is that where I want to be?
    
12. What activities in the last month have energised me, and what activities in the last month have drained me? How can I do more of what energises me and less of what has drained me?
    
13. When it comes to my work or my life, what is the goal and what is the primary bottleneck?
    
14. Do I work for my business or does my business work for me?
    
15. If I knew I was going to die two years from now, how would I spend my time?
    
16. What’s the biggest bottleneck to achieving my next goal and why aren’t I working on it?
    
17. How much do my current goals reflect my own desires versus someone else’s?
    
18. What are some areas in which I could invest more money to make life smoother and easier for myself?
    
19. What could I do to make my life more meaningful?
    
20. What do I wish I could do more quickly? And what do I wish I could do more slowly?
    
21. What backpack am I carrying that no longer serves me?

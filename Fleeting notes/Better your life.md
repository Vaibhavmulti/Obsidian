Figuring out where you are in life

Rate yourself out of 10 out of each of these.

I am tempted to rate myself based on my routine that I used to follow but that is not the case anymore, so either we can hope that we will follow that and rate accordingly or we can mention why we should follow it.
Let's rate both ways 

Ideal routine             |                What we are doing right now

Health:
- Physical : 9 (4-5 times a week including hiit which was great for cardiovascular and overall strength building),    4 ( Too much alcohol , too less exercise and too less walks)
- Mental : 5 (Too much stress while placements about the unknown, constant stress). 6 (No stress but lack of motive and feeling what am I doing)
- Spiritual : 7 (Meditation routine, helped a bit could have been better) , 7 (Sitting here feels nice , quiet and spiritual , water sound , birds , people just walking around don't care, could use more of this)

Work:
- Mission : 9 (Learning directly what I want to learn for the rest of the life) , 5 (Not directly learning , procrastinating in the face of productivity but yeah we are relaxing , is this good? Are we missing something?)
- Money : 7 (Broke but got a decent job), 6 (Are we managing good ? Well I don't think much for experiences which I feel is nice , and I don't like to feel that we have less, make enough to have the freedom to enjoy experience without every thinking about money)
- Growth: 6 (Only technical, should include personal book reading), 6 (No technical but giving time to what matters (note taking , system building), still include books )

Relationship:
- Family : 4 (Always missing from functions while in kanpur, didn't hate it but yeah ), 6 (Was more in functions, giving time to family ? Not really they are missing my presence)
- Friends : 8 (Adequate time there), 8 (Adequate time now )
- Romantic : 7 (Always made the time but state of mind was not right ), 7 (Present for here but don't want to pin her for her mistakes and what I expect of her)

What needs to be worked and actionable advice:

What needs to be worked in ideal routine?
Mental health : Don't be too strict, do a little less to have some breathing space so that stress is not there and make sure to have good time each day.
Spiritual health : Meditate consistently , follow different guided meditation and listen to different people in waking up.
Money: Have a side money generating project so that we can be financially free.
Work Growth: Have a reading routine, block time , incorporate readwise to remove the moental toll of remembering.
Family: Be present whenever you are with them. Try to spend more time with them.
Romantic relationship : Try to listen to her more , what she actually wants , don't let your state of mind get into your relationship.

What needs to be worked now?
Physical health: Drink less, exercise more.
Mental health: If you are note relaxing or feeling like you are missing out or anything else just be clear with your priorities, work and relax.

Clearly if I was following the ideal routine I had less things to work on so better to follow it. 

What can be done better if we follow the ideal routine.






Figure out the things that you want to improve, then have a 12 month celebration thing. Where do I want to see myself in 12 months / what one thing  do I want to celebrate after 12 months of work in the thing that needs to be improved.

A key hack while setting goals , add the phrase while enjoying everything along the way at the end of the goal :)
Write the goals down! and make recurring reviews (monthly/quarterly..)


Mind optimises for safety not for growth.

I want to build a daily routine for mobility and entire posture correction.
The big aim of this is to :
Have great Longevity
Fix asymmetries where ever they are. Include everything so that I can target everything.
Fix problem like anterior pelvic twist, right knee pain during squat, round shoulders, misalignments and all other ailments which I am not aware but they exist silently.
Fix pain (Hips, back, shoulders, knees, neck, pain during squat)
Have a Bulletproof body.
So the routine should be such that it fixes all and makes the body bulletproof and as a perfectly healthy human body should be.

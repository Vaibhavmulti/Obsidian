#### Capture 
- Brain is for having ideas not for storing them so capture them as soon as you see them. (Use calendar (birthdays, events, block time for exercise / reading ), to-do list , note taking app). What to capture? Ideas, Highlights, Quotes.
- Every email hits you only once , if it is a an event add to calendar, if it is a to do thing add to todoist, if it is an article add it to read it later app.

The stuff you collected NOT into folders but organise them by actionability (Where will I potentially use this? Which project will I use this in?)

#### Distill 
Progressive summarisation. 

#### Express

Capture, Brain is for having ideas not for storing them so   capture them as soon as you see them. (Use calendar (birthdays, events, block time for exercise / reading ), to-do list , note taking app). What to capture? Ideas, Highlights, Quotes.   

Organise, the stuff you collected NOT into folders but organise them by actionability (Where will I potentially use this? Which project will I use this in?)

Distill, Progressive summarisation.

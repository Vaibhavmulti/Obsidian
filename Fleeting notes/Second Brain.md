#### Capture 
- Brain is for having ideas not for storing them so capture them as soon as you see them. (Use calendar (birthdays, events, block time for exercise / reading ), to-do list , note taking app). What to capture? Ideas, Highlights, Quotes.
- Every email hits you only once , if it is a an event add to calendar, if it is a to do thing add to todoist, if it is an article add it to read it later app. 


#### Organise 
The stuff you collected NOT into folders but organise them by actionability (Where will I potentially use this? Which project will I use this in?)

#### Distill 
Progressive summarisation. 

#### Express  
Exactly what to do , how to do it.
Can be expressed to others or to ourselves.

 Progressive summarisation
 Highlighting on steroids (Highlight the most relevant information so that by just reading that we can make sense of the entire document)

Process?
Highlight as usual -> Bold the imp things -> Finally Highlight the most important bolds such that we get the entire picture if we just look at these highlights. 






Use NotebookLM for summarising papers and doing a study guide.
Do a Map of Concept (A single page acts as an index to everything else)
Can be done with whole AI ML , we can have math, ML , DL , RL , CV there
